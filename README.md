# Exolve Editor

A simple text editor to import [qxw](https://www.quinapalus.com/qxw.html) files into [exolve](https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exolve).

Loaded qxw files are converted to exolve format and merged into `exolve.html`. (`exolve.html` needs to be downloaded separately.)

## Usage

1. Click `Load QXW` to load a qxw file. The grid will be converted to exolve,
   and filled into the left pane.
1. Click `Copy to clipboard` if you want to paste the converted grid into an
   html file in a separate editor.
1. Click `Load exolve template` and then `Save Exolve` if you want the editor
   to merge the converted grid into an exolve html file for you.

Both the crossword and the html template panes are editable, but it's probably
easier to just save the exolve file and then edit it in your favourite text
editor.
