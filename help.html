<h1>Exolve Editor</h1>

Exolve Editor, as the name suggests, is an editor for
files used by the excellent <a href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exolve">Exolve interactive crossword player</a>.

An exolve file consists of two parts:
<ul>
  <li>A <b>crossword</b>, defined in a structured text format (see the <a href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exolve">Exolve README</a> for details).</li>
  <li>A <b>template</b>, one of two files that ship with
    exolve, either <a
      href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exolve/blob/master/exolve-m.html">exolve-m.html</a>
    or <a
      href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exolve/blob/master/exolve.html">exolve.html</a>.
</ul>

The crossword is merged into the template to create a standalone HTML file that can be loaded into your browser to solve the crossword interactively, or hosted on your website to present your readers with an interactive crossword.

<h2>Crosswords</h2>
To load a crossword, click
<ul>
  <li><b>Load Exolve</b>: Extracts the crossword from an existing exolve file. This is useful for, e.g., moving a crossword from an old exolve file and merging it with the latest version of the template.</li>
  <li><b>Import QXW</b>: Loads a <a href="https://www.quinapalus.com/qxw.html">QXW save file</a> and converts it into exolve format</a>. Note that
  <ul>
    <li>Only the rectangular format is supported</li>
    <li>Clues will be generated from the grid, in the form "1. ANSWER", since QXW is purely a grid creation app and does not support clues</li>
  </ul>
  You can add clues directly within this app, but it's probably more convenient to save the converted file and edit it in your favourite text editor.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Templates</h2>
Once your crossword is ready, it needs to be merged with
an exolve template. Download either <a
href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exolve/blob/master/exolve-m.html">exolve-m.html</a>
or <a
     href="https://github.com/viresh-ratnakar/exolve/blob/master/exolve.html">exolve.html</a>
to your computer, then click <b>Load Exolve Template</b>
to load it into the <b><i>Template</i></b> tab. (If you
are not sure what the difference between the two files
is, you probably want <tt>exolve.html</tt>.)

<h2>Saving the completed file</h2>
When you are read to save, click on <b>Save Exolve</b>. This will merge the contents of the <b><i>Crossword</i></b> and <b><i>Template</i></b> tabs and create an HTML file.

To load a crossword, click
<p>Click 'Load QXW' to load a qxw file. The file will be
converted to exolve.  After that, you can 'Copy to
clipboard' to copy the generated exolve text, and paste it
into your html file, or 'Load exolve template' followed by
'Save exolve' to merge your crossword into an exolve html
file.</p>

<h2>Exporting to other formats</h2>
While this app is primarily focused on exolve files, the contents of the <b><i>Crossword</i></b> tab can be converted to other formats. Currently the only other supported format is the crossword markup used by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crosswords/comments/reiym/new_markup_for_posting_crossowords/">the /r/crosswords subreddit</a>; <a href="https://github.com/martindemello/exolve-editor/issues">open an issue</a> if you would like some other export format, or see my <a href="https://github.com/martindemello/pangrid"><i>pangrid</i> command line tool</a> for a more general conversion utility.

Clicking on <b>Output Reddit</b> will convert the current crossword to reddit markup format, and write it to the <b><i>Output</i></b> tab, where it can be copied or saved.
